# User Workspace

## Project Overview
The **User Workspace** project is designed to facilitate the creation and management of styled web applications using modern CSS frameworks. It leverages **Tailwind CSS**, **PostCSS**, and **Autoprefixer** for efficient styling, ensuring your application is both responsive and adheres to current web standards.

## Installation
To set up the project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, you can install the required dependencies using npm.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd user-workspace
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start working with the project by building your CSS files using PostCSS with Tailwind CSS.

To build your styles, create a new CSS file with the Tailwind directives and run the following command:
```bash
npx postcss <input-css-file>.css -o <output-css-file>.css
```
Replace `<input-css-file>` with your source file and `<output-css-file>` with the desired output file name.

## Features
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Quickly build custom designs directly in your HTML.
- **Autoprefixer**: Automatically add vendor prefixes to your CSS properties, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- **PostCSS**: Use advanced features such as custom properties, nested rules, and more.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following development dependencies:
- **autoprefixer**: `^10.4.21`
- **postcss**: `^8.5.3`
- **tailwindcss**: `^4.1.3`

These libraries are specified in the `package.json` file and will be installed automatically when you run `npm install`.

## Project Structure
The project follows a straightforward structure to maintain clarity:

```
user-workspace/
├── node_modules/               # Contains installed npm packages
├── package.json                # Project manifest with dependencies
├── package-lock.json           # Locks the versions of installed dependencies
└── src/                        # Source directory for your styles and scripts
    ├── styles/                 # Custom CSS files
    │   └── main.css            # Main CSS file (with Tailwind directives)
    └── index.html              # Sample HTML file to integrate styles
```

Feel free to modify the structure as needed and add your own custom files and components to this framework.
